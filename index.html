                producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). It is also "any
                activity or enterprise entered into for profit."

                Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner
                of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Finance is a field that deals with the study of money and investments.
                It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of
                uncertainty and risk. In the context of business and management, finance deals with the problems of
                ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its operational and financial objectives;
                i.e. that it: has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses, and can
                service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments. Finance also
                deals with the long term objective of maximizing the value of the business, while also balancing risk
                and profitability.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Research and development refer to activities in connection with
                corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of
                development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to
                manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly
                how to accomplish the desired result.Sales are activity related to selling or the number of goods or
                services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key
                to a companies' success. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in
                1494.
